# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
	About everything in Javascript is an object except for data like strings, numbers, booleans, null, and undefined. Objects can have properties onto you can assign a value or function.
	
	* Properties
	In a way these are like descriptions that an object has or functions that it does. Properties can be modified and there can even be properties of properties!
	
	* Methods
	Methods are functions that an object has uniquely for itself. They are called into action from the name of the property and not the name of the function. The function can be anonymously named.
	
	* for in loop
	A loop that will address every property in a chosen object. It can be used to search through and find a property within an object that has a bunch of properties or calculate statistics of property values.
	
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation
	Dot notation is most commonly used to identify properties and methods. Bracket notation can be used the same way but must be used to call an argument as a property in a function.
